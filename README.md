# Bank-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard

Customer churn is a major challenge in the banking sector, as losing customers directly impacts profitability. This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to identify the key factors contributing to churn and to build an interactive dashboard for monitoring churn patterns and customer segments.
